Introduction
------------

You can download the latest officially signed, weekly or stable re-motion build 
from the Downloads section at www.re-motion.org. In most cases this is your best
option, since you can easily upgrade your re-motion version as new releases
become available. 

If however you want to build your own version of re-motion, either from 
Visual Studio or from the command line, this text will tell you how to go 
about this task. 

Important: Please note that to build your own version of re-motion you need to 
create your own key to sign your assembles. Please refer to 
"Creating your own remotion.snk keyfile" below on how to do this.


Getting re-motion
-----------------

To get the latest version of the re-motion source code, check it out from the 
SVN server (https://svn.re-motion.org/svn/Remotion/trunk/) 
(Note: The following examples assume that you check out the sourcecode into 
"c:\Remotion"; you can, of course, pick any other directory structure you like):

md c:\Remotion 
cd c:\Remotion 
svn checkout https://svn.re-motion.org/svn/Remotion/trunk/ trunk 

(To obtain the SVN tool, please go to http://subversion.tigris.org/; 
alternatively you can also use TortoiseSVN from http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ 
if you prefer a graphical user interface.) 


Creating your own remotion.snk keyfile
--------------------------------------

We cannot provide the official remotion.snk keyfile, so you will need to 
create your own.
To do so, simply run the "Generate-Snk.cmd" script from a Visual Studio Command 
Prompt. If you do not use a Visual Studio Command Prompt, you will need to make 
sure the .NET SDK is on your PATH.

cd c:\Remotion
Generate-Snk.cmd

Note that the newly generated key file will not match the original key used 
by rubicon to sign re-motion assemblies.


Building re-motion from Visual Studio
-------------------------------------

After getting the sources and a remotion.snk, just load Remotion.sln in 
Visual Studio and build it. It should work.

To run all the tests from NUnit, make sure you have a local installation of
SQL Server 2005. You might need to create C:\Databases and 
C:\Databases\ftdata directories by hand to make the unit tests work.


Building re-motion with NAnt
----------------------------

After getting the sources and a remotion.snk, run Build-RemotionLocal.cmd
from the re-motion trunk directory:

cd c:\Remotion
Build-RemotionLocal.cmd

re-motion contains a customized version of NAnt which is used for the build
in the prereq\Tools\NAnt folder.

As with the Visual Studio build, you need a local installation of 
SQL Server 2005 to run the full build. You might also need to create 
C:\Databases and C:\Databases\ftdata directories by hand to make the unit 
tests work.

The build scripts will create temporary files in your C:\Temp directory.

To generate documentation files for re-motion, run Build-RemotionLocalDoc.cmd.
