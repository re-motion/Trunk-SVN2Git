// For this preview release you should manually add control declarations to this class.
// For example:
//
//    public partial class MyClass
//    {
//        public Button Button1;
//        public Label Label1;
//    }
//
// In future releases this file will be auto-generated and you will not need to add
// declarations manually.  The auto-generation in future releases will rewrite this file.
// For this reason do not place other code in this file as it will be lost.
