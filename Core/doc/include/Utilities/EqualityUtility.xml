    <summary>
      Gets the hash code of the individual arguments, XOR'd with bits rotated.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>
        This method XOR's the hash codes of all individual arguments in order to create a compound hash code
        for the entire set of arguments. Between XOR's, the compound hash code is rotated by 11 bits in order
        to better distribute hash codes of types that aggregate their hash results toward the least-significant
        side of the result (small numbers, booleans).
      </para>
      <para>
        Overloads with type arguments are identical to the object-array version, they only reduce the amount
        of boxing going on (better performance).
