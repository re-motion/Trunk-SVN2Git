  /// class A : Attribute { ... }
  /// class B : A { ... }
  /// class C : Attribute { ... }
  /// </code>

  /// In this example, a call to GetCustomAttributes on typeof (DerivedDerived) would yield the following attributes:

  /// </para>
  /// <para>
  /// [A ("Base")] and [A ("DerivedDerived")] are suppressed due
  /// to the <see cref="SuppressAttributesAttribute"/> on Derived's declaration. [B ("Base")] and [B ("DerivedDerived")] are also suppressed, because
  /// they inherit from A, which is suppressed. The C attributes are not suppressed because they are not related to A; [A ("Derived")] and
