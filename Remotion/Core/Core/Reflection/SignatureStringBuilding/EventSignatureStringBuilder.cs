  /// Builds a string representing the signature of a given <see cref="EventInfo"/> object. This is similar to the string returned by 
  /// <see cref="object.ToString"/> as it contains a textual representation of the event's type.
  /// It's different from <see cref="object.ToString"/>, though, because it does not contain the event's name.

  /// For simplicity, this class assumes that type or namespace names cannot contain the character "[". 
  /// It also assumes that the full name of a type (namespace, enclosing type (if any), 
  /// and simple type name) is enough to identify a type - assembly information is not encoded. The 1:1 mapping of signature strings to event 
  /// signatures is only guaranteed for events that adhere to these assumptions.
