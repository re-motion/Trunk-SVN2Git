- No SuppressAttribute required: If the target class already implements the interface added by the mixin, the mixin implementation is ignored.
- Members added by a mixin cannot be overridden by other mixins. You can derive from the mixin, but cannot change the "This" property unless the original mixin was designed for this purpose.
- Mixins cannot currently be configured for a complete interface.
