*) Implement stable binding performance tests (to make sure refactorings do not break caching and lead to e.g. 10000x worse runtime behavior)
*) Implement "ScriptContextNone" scheme: Special ScriptContext which is enabled by default and creates no proxy but instead just returns the proxied 
object itself. 
*) Clean code (start with StableBindingProxyBuilder)
