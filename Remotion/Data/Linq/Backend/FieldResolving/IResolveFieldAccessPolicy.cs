  /// Resolution of fields in select, where, and orderby clauses works very similarly. For example, <c>customer.Order.OrderNumber</c> always results

  /// a <see cref="SingleJoin"/> between <c>Customer</c> and <c>Order</c>).

  /// However, there are a few specifics to the way how expressions that access entities (such as in relations, e.g. <c>customer.Order</c>,
  /// or by directly accessing the identifier, e.g. <c>customer</c>) should be handled. By implementing this policy, a user of the resolver can
